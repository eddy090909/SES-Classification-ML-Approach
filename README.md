# SES Classification Using Machine Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning to classify the socioeconomic status (SES) of neighborhoods based on visual data from satellite imagery and Google Street View. It combines technical implementation with policy-aware analysis of algorithmic fairness and ethical risk.

## 📚 Overview

Completed as a final project for QAC239: Machine Learning at Wesleyan University, this work investigates the predictive power of spatial imagery for SES classification and compares modeling performance across visual modalities.

## 🔍 Highlights

- Trained and evaluated multiple supervised classifiers on structured and image-based data
- Compared predictive accuracy of **satellite imagery** vs. **Google Street View**
- Conducted feature engineering, model tuning, and performance evaluation in Python (Google Colab)
- Co-authored a final research paper evaluating the ethical, policy, and equity implications of applying ML to SES inference
- Redacted all sensitive credentials for responsible open-source release

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, PyTorch
- **APIs**: Google Maps Platform (Street View API)
- **Data**: U.S. Census socioeconomic indicators and geo-coordinates
- **Environment**: Google Colab, GitHub, Google Drive
